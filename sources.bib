By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9\% of which had been recycled, 12\% was incinerated, and 79\% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The population has a significant influence on economic growth, energy consumption, and climate change. Many scholars and organizations have published projections for China's future population due to its substantial population amounts. However, these projections have not been evaluated or analyzed, which may lead confusion to extensional studies based on these datasets. This manuscript compares several China's projection datasets at multiscale and analyzes the impacting factors affecting projection accuracy. The results indicate that the slow of actual population growth rates from 2017 is earlier than most datasets projected. Therefore, the turning point of population decline probably comes rapidly before these datasets expected during 2024 and 2034. Furthermore, the projections do not reveal the population decline from 2010 in the Northeast provinces such as Jilin and Heilongjiang, and underrate the population increase in the southern provinces such as Guangdong and Chongqing. According to the results of regression models, the rate of population changes and the number of migrations people play a significant role in projection accuracy. These findings provide meaningful guidance for scholars to understand the uncertainty of those projection datasets. Moreover, for researchers performing population projections, our discoveries provide insights to increase the projection accuracy.},

Specifically, this study investigates the impacts of this policy on landfills, and the risks to the U.S. plastics secondary materials market and material recovery facilities ({MRFs}). A hierarchical regression analysis reveals the significant impacts of China’s Green Fence and National Sword polices on the amount landfilled plastic. Controlling for oil prices, producer price index ({PPI}), and amount of plastic scrap exported, our findings show that the Green Fence had no statistically significant impact on the amount of plastic landfilled in the U.S. However, the quantity of plastic landfilled in the U.S. increased by 23.2\% following the implementation of National Sword. Furthermore, analysis of the annual reports submitted by registered {MRFs} in New York ({NY}) state reveals that the total amount of plastic recovered by them has decreased. We suggest that demand creation and investments that improve the quality of bales are needed to help solve this economic dilemma.},

            The production, consumption, and waste of plastics have been rapidly growing worldwide in the last decades. A variety of data are needed to characterize plastics stocks and flows across space, time, and life cycle to derive insights for developing strategies to address various sustainability challenges from plastics and plastics waste. Here we review data sources on plastics stocks and flows to identify data gaps and research needs. We categorize the reviewed data sources by life cycle stages of plastics including material production, semi‐manufacturing, manufacturing, additives, consumption, in‐use stock, end‐of‐life, waste treatment, and trade. We identify four data gaps in these existing data for characterizing plastics stocks and flows, including inconsistent classification, missing data, conflicting data, and inexplicit data for plastics products and waste. These data gaps represent critical research needs including common platform for data sharing, standard methods for data reconciliation and estimation, consistent data collection and reporting, and new approaches for data collection and curation. This review establishes the state‐of‐the‐art of plastics stock and flow data and develops a roadmap for a high‐quality, comprehensive characterization of plastics stocks and flows to develop management strategies to address the sustainability challenges of plastics production, consumption, waste, and pollution.},

            To reduce plastic bag litter, China introduced a nationwide regulation requiring all retailers to charge for plastic shopping bags on 1 June 2008. By using the policy implementation as a natural experiment and collecting individual-level data before and after the implementation, we investigate the impacts of the regulation on consumers’ bag use. We find that the regulation implementation caused a 49 per cent reduction in the use of new bags. Besides regulation enforcement, consumers’ attitude toward the regulation and some consumers’ socioeconomic characteristics also affected bag consumption. However, the regulation effects differ largely among consumer groups and among regions and shopping occasions.},

            Japan implemented mandatory charging for single-use plastic shopping bags in 2020. In this study, we verified the policy effect and its persistence by analyzing the changes in the number of plastic shopping bags taken and discarded by consumers before and after the charging came into effect. Online surveys were conducted in 2016, 2021, 2022, and 2023 for consumers residing in municipalities in Tokyo. The results showed that the number of plastic shopping bags taken decreased to approximately 30\% after the charging was implemented, from 5.8 bags per person per week in 2016 to 1.7–1.9 in 2021–2023, and the number of bags discarded decreased from 6.2 to 3.0–3.4. The number of bags taken in 2021–2023 after the charging was implemented did not change significantly. Regarding the relationship with other waste policies, in municipalities that have introduced designated trash bags, the number of plastic shopping bags taken and discarded was fewer than in other municipalities even before the charging was introduced, by removing the option of reusing plastic bags as trash bags. This result indicates that, when introducing such policies, the relationship with existing waste policies must be analyzed to predict their effect.},
